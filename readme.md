## How to run project

Follow this steps to set up the project:

- git clone the project (git@github.com:vic0707/strapi-video.git)

- Run `npm install` in both the main project, the frontend folder and the backend folder.

- After all three are built, you should be able to run the project by simply running `npm run dev` from the top folder. It might take some time, and fail at first because the front might be ready before the backend. If you have issues, you can open two terminal windows and run the frontend folder with `npm run dev` and the backend project with `npm run develop`

- Then just going to http://localhost:3000/ should display the list of videos.
